                <h3>Reminder - What is W3Develops Cohorts?</h3>
                <p>W3Develops Cohorts is building a global collaboration capital for tech-learners. Here is what we do: put motivated people with similar goals together in an environment that gives them the opportunity to level-up in a way they couldn't otherwise. We place developers, designers, data scientists and digital marketers in teams to learn/build!</p>
